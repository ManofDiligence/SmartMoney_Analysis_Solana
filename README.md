# SmartMoney_Analysis_Solana
# December 2023 ~ January 2024:
## The UniSwap one is the past project i did that i think that was a failure,
## This project that i just found out some traders with win rate (>80%), and copy their public address, 
# use Etherscan api to track their transaction 24/7, (i put it in GCP VM instance and run it), 
# once i found them who has a new ERC-20 transfer in their wallet (buy/sell),
# i basically followed their actions to trade with my wallet (Use uniswap api to swap WETH to the target token), (I did paper trading at first).
# But there are many problems, like The gas fee of Ethereum is expensive (>10u each transaction).
# and sometimes these smart trader like to target some new listed token which these token may locked their own liquidity pool,
# which was really bad for me, (i can't sell it after sell it, since the token's pool is locked)

# January 2024 ~ Present
# Transformation
# Now, i want to switch to the solana networks, with more features in this new Project
# 0: find out some smart traders on birdeye with (win rate > 80%)
# 1. Analyze the strategy by getting and analyzing their transaction data from solscan
# 2. and i hope that in step 0 and 1, we can find some similarites among them
# 3. Design a better and profitable strategy in my project, 3.1: coding, 3.2: paper trading
# 4. Trading with this program by actually putting real money!
